# ASCII Art Generator

Convert your images into stunning ASCII art using this Python-based ASCII Art Generator. This project takes an image as input and generates ASCII art by mapping the intensity of each pixel to a character from a predefined set of characters. The result is a unique and visually appealing representation of the original image in text form.

## Features

- Generate ASCII art from images.
- Choose from a variety of characters to create the ASCII art.
- Scale the output ASCII art based on the desired size.
- Save the generated ASCII art as an image file.
  
## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install Pillow`.
3. Run the `ascii_art_generator.py` script, providing the input image path.
4. Adjust the scale factor, character set, and other settings as desired.
5. The generated ASCII art will be saved as an image file.
